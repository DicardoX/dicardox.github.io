I'm Chunyu Xue, a fourth-year Direct PhD Candidate in [Emerging Parallel Computing Center (EPCC)](http://epcc.sjtu.edu.cn) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Quan Chen](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~chen-quan/index_EN.html). My research interests lie in building efficient and scalable systems for LLM and MultiModal training, fine-tuning, and cluster-level scheduling. 
Currently, I'm working as a research intern in ByteDance Seed-Infrastructure-Training. I worked as an engineering intern in Microsoft Cloud+AI. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from SJTU.
